/*
 FAMTREE helps you build a genealogical database that can later be
     converted to HTML.  The database can be constructed in parts and
     later joined to form a coherent whole.  More than one 'family'
     can be defined and there are routines that can splice parts of
     one family with another.  It builds an ISPF table defined as

.     KEYS(FTSEQ)
.     NAMES(FTSEQL FTNAME FTBIRTH FTDEATH FTSPOUSE FTWEDDT FTTEXT,
.           FTSEQ2 FTSPBD FTSPDD FTEMAIL FTSPEML )

     and named for the family whose data it contains.  Thus data for
     multiple families may be kept on individual tables.  Since its
     use involves ISPF tables, an ISPEXEC environment is required.
     Subroutines in active use are:

       FTIMPORT -- used to replicate data from family A to family B

       REORDER  -- (operates on a FLTTBL-copy) resequences rows that
            are out of order.

       SHUFFLE  -- (operates on a FLTTBL-copy) is a subroutine of
            REORDER and actually does the resequencing.  On return
            from SHUFFLE, REORDER recreates the original table as
            corrected by SHUFFLE.

       BRTHDAYS -- collects all birthday and anniversay dates with
            names, and creates a sorted list for later processing.

       HEADSUP  -- reports on upcoming dates in the birthday and
            anniversary list.

       ORDINAL  -- adds the ordinal 'tail' to numbers, e.g.: 'th' for
            37th, or 'st' for 21st.


 PREPARATION:

 Load the contents of this library to an appropriate library available
     to all who should have access to FAMTREE.

 Prior to running FAMTREE, if there presently does not exist a table
     called AAMSTR in your ISPTLIB concatenation, issue the following
     command from within ISPF:
          ===> tso %tblmstr (( install
     With an AAMSTR table in place, invoke GENFT to establish the FT
     table type on the AAMSTR table.  GENFT should be discarded after
     successful execution.

 The first use of FAMTREE will use the parameters stored on the AAMSTR
     table to generate a new FT-type table for use by FAMTREE.
     Each time FAMTREE is called with a table name(family name) that
     does not presently exist, a new table for that family will be
     generated.
